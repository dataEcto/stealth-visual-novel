# stealth-visual-novel

A Prototype made for Major Studio Fall that combines a Top Down Game with a Visual Novel.

I'm not exactly sure why I thought this was anything close to a good idea TBH.

Stuff included in this are:

- Intergration with an Assest called Fungus, a visual novel like tool
- Top Down Character movement
- Room to Room Camera system (think Legend of Zelda)
